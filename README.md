# Password Generator (Python)

A simple Python program to generate random passwords based on user-defined criteria.

## Features

- Generates passwords with a minimum length specified by the user.
- Optionally includes numbers and special characters.
- Ensures the generated password meets the criteria set by the user.
- Uses Python's `random` and `string` modules to select characters.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Save the code in a file named `password_generator.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the file.
4. Run the program using:
python password_generator.py
5. Follow the prompts to enter the minimum password length and whether to include numbers and special characters.
6. The program will output a randomly generated password matching your specifications.

## What I Learned and Used

- Using Python's built-in `random` and `string` modules for character selection.
- Constructing password generators that meet certain complexity rules.
- Implementing input handling and validation for user choices.
- Building loops that generate characters and check multiple conditions.
- Combining boolean logic to enforce password criteria.
